"Yes, since I know it's reliable",,,
"no bc it is not a doctor and cannot see me or visit me, it only has some data. As I would't trust someone who has only read a mediacl manual to visit me. For this task you need not only the information but the experience and know-how that google does not posses.","no bc I wouldn't trust anyone who is not a professional that can physically percieve me. For medical purposes I would more likely call my doctor rather than trusting some information on the internet. I believe that to give useful advice in medically urgent situations you need not only the information, but the experience apart from the ability to connect symtoms. Many deseases heve very similar symtoms and by only looking at those with non-professional eyes it is very easy to be triked. I like using the information I find on the internet to maybe understand the overral situation, to know how preoccupied I should be. but I would never trust the info I understood from the internet. In every scenario I would ask a professional. (plus the doctors EVERY TIME tell me that what I got prom the internet is partial and is missing the context so it ins't in fact useful but more misleading)","yes as long as I'm asking about permanent things such as museums, monuments, galleries...",Yes but surely I would need to revisit it. I wouldn't take 100% of the information I got maybe I would rather use it as inspo
Because I can compare different sources of information provided by goggle ,It just gives me one answer ,,
"Searching your illness on google is a bad idea, it's better for technical stuff, bet it cannot help with human body as much since it requires a lot of factors into consideration",Never tried searching medical stuff on chatGPT,Travelling is mainly done on google in my life so i think in this topic it is okay,"It is good for tourist places and other things to find, maybe not so much with flight information"

It depends on so many variables (+ Google does not interpret your prompts!),"Again, it depends. But I must say that I am a bit biased when it comes to AI: it frightens me a bit","Yes, because I can look up multiple articles","Yes, but I prefer not to"
,,,
"Yes, because I will search more sources and compare them to try and find an accurate response.","Is accurate enough in giving responses, while not always correct, I can just check on other sites to see if they agree",Because is a simple task and will return a list,Is a simple task it is hard to make errors unless is an unknown place
"I wouldn’t, basically because I’m not an expert in the field therefore the information I receive could be misleading ","I wouldn’t be fully comfortable also in that case, maybe I would be just a little bit more confident regarding reliability and scenario consistency ","Yes I would, because it is one of the best working Google features","Yes I would, because it is trained on several data and the consequences of its use in this scenario are not potentially as dangerous as the ones in the previous scenario "
"No, because sometimes the information could be  too exaggerated. I can sometimes be curious and google, but I will be more comfortable using the info provided by my doctor. ",I could say that it might be more accurate than google but I would double with my doctor anyway. ,Google has been my ally for trips since forever!,"I havent really used ChatGPT for trips but based on my experience with it, Im confident it would help me"
"Yes, they often accurately describe the symptoms and recommendations.",,,
,"Yes. I wouldn't decide based solely on it, but I would use it to better understand what is happening to me ",,
I feel comfortable with all the sources it provides but at the same time the information is not always accurate and includes many advisers ,"Yeah, because it’s really accurate when the information it provides ",Google is more reliable but the information and responses are more general and not always useful,ChatGPT is really helpful and provides you with the specific information you ask
"Yes, but more research and more effort should be made","Yes, as long as I provide good context and the response is reasonable","Yes, because I can decide based on other people's experiences.",Yes because I have done it already and ChatGPT can provide many options and you can choose one according to your needs.
"I think I feel a little bit more comfortable, because of al the results that google bring us could led to a deeper research. But once again, I do not prefer to trust my health to one of these systems.","No, because I think it could led to generic solutions and when talking about health I feel more comfortable recieving a diagnostic and treatment from a doctor.","I feel comfortable, since google is like my main place's reviews source. But I dont like to use it since it takes more time to make the research than it took on chatgpt.","Yes, mainly because I am lazzy and chatgpt has a good understanding of traveling plans and schedule organization. It makes my life easier."
The answers are more varied,Yes. The answer is more personalized ,"Yes, but its for a specific information",The answers are very efficients while planning a trip
"Yes, but when they are general issues, if there is something very specific I prefer to go to a specialist","I can look for that type of information, but not necessarily believe what it tells me, possibly I look for more sources to corroborate",I believe that Google can give me more precise information if I search for it separately,"Yes, I think it's more general information that you can search for separately and put together yourself, whereas ChatGPT can do it for you"
,"Yes, because it would save me some time ",,"Yes, because I think the information provided by Chat GPT is more accurate "
No. I prefer to ask to a healthcare professional,No. I prefer to ask to a healthcare professional,"No, because I have to be sure it is about the topic I need so it takes time to finally find the right information","Yes, because it isn't about a sensitive matter."
"Not at all, google tends to exagerate these type of situarions providing the answer for the worst case scenarios possible","Yes, even if its answer is not accurate, it will be close enough",Because I trust the information here is up to date,No because I don't think the informarion is up to date
"Yes, since in Google you can find information from different sources, read suggestions and recommendations from doctors and much more information on the subject","I wouldn't feel completely comfortable, since there are times that Chatgpt. Or he interprets well what is asked of him and he has to be constantly detailing so that he can provide more specific information",,"Yes, I would feel comfortable since it offers different options to visit and also helps you put together itineraries"
"Yes, but it is limited. You cannot do complex queries on google search and, if you do so, probably google won't found anything or will give me a partial answer. Anyways, I find well having this tool to query things more directly and, in any case, it is my first option.","yes, because i have the posibility to discriminate whether the information ChatGPT gave me is reliable or not depending on the sources it queried. If you ask with an accurate prompt the probability of receive an hallucination or a wrong answer reduces.","Yes, because I can choose the official places for some specific places so I discard the wrong information.","Yes, because it give me a summarize of all the places I can visit. It may have some wrong answers or bad querying with prices and schedules."
I like that I have sources that back up what it's saying,"Yes, because chatgpt give me more precise information",Because it has many images with variety of options to make me choose,Yes because usually chatgpt gives me exactly the answers I want
"Yes, because it is easier for me to access from my cell phone.","If I need simple recommendations, yes, because ChatGPT can provide summarized common information.","Yes, because I've done it before.",It seems to me that the information would not be so up-to-date
"Becuase there is more access to diferente websites, blogs, forms, videos, images.",I think health issues are more important and we should use more variety of information and not only rely on chatGPT,"The possibility of being able to review images, forums, pages where people post reviews or ratings to different places allows me to have an idea of the places I want to go.","Yes I would feel comfortable since I can specify and give details of the places I would like to visit to have a wide variety of places or recommendations. Once I have the recommendations I can use google search to see images, forums, references or opinions."
,I wouldn’t rely my health situation to anything or anyone but a doctor,More or less,Because ChatGPT can provide an opinion made of others website’s realiable opinions
I think there are more confident vlogs or articles written by professionals who could be more asserted than the AI,"Not too much, because the AI ​​might be wrong and give me an incorrect health assessment or, worse, wrong recommendations","This is more complicated because Google offers you a lot of website and vlogs with the same information and is not customized at all, it's complicated to get a custom itinerary or something similar using the google search engine","Yes, I feel comfortable because this kind of information rarely changes and ChatGPT could give you a good overview about destinations and itineraries of many places"
"No, due to the immense amount of web pages that have no support of any kind, be it expert judgment, bibliographic or otherwise, on their medical contents","No, because I don't think ChatGPT is capable yet of answering correctly to most questions related to medical advice",No because Google is connected to most social networks that would start to recommend ads based on the search that I've just done,"Yes, because of past experiences that have been addressed correctly"
"I think Google is even more general in these scenarios; therefore, it is more likely to provide inaccurate information.","Not really. If for some really I truly need to search for the info, I'll do it. But I'd rather contact a professional. ","I would feel comfortable; however, I prefer the IA in this one, as Google will redirect you to different sites, and it is a little harder to get all the recommendations in one place, increasing user effort.","Yes, I think there is a faster way to get this information, as it gathers all the information you would usually check site by site."
It was my habit for years although I dislike advertising and too many cookies ,,"Not really I prefer for travelling ChatGPT in terms of  things to do , places to visit and organizing a trip ",Yes I am quite confident on this type of scenarios 
,,,
The problem is that it's difficult to find an answer for the exact symptoms you present and that belongs to a trusty webpage,"Not for a diagnosis, but it can be useful to monitor symptoms since ChatGPT can give you an estimate of their supposed duration. Example: if it says that a common cold can last up to 10 days and I'm in day 12 and not getting better... That is a clear sign that you need a medical appointment ","Yes, timsiof information, photos and reviews",Never been in that scenario 
Yes because I can see the source and judge if I trust it or not,"I would ask just for curiosity, but would take the answer with a pinch of salt, as I know chatgpt is a probabilistic model and not an expert. For matters as serious as health the best strategy is to be skeptical","I feel confortable although it is more of a pain in the ass, chatgpt is short and swee t and goes to the point, I believe it understands better what I am asking for",Yes because the subject is less serious and chatgpt avoids me having to read and contrast amd unnecessary amount of information for a job which I want to be quick and easy such as searching for good trip recommendations
I would indeed feel comfortable. Google provides updated information and I can clearly know the source of the data provided. ,"Not really. As far as I know, Chat GPT works by combining a series of offline data into a single answer. In this way, the user does not know the sources employed and the information can be outdated.","I would feel comfortable using Google, I would actually preffer it to Chat GPT in this case because it can also provide subjective data (e.g. people´s reflections on the most famous landmarks, including reviews).",I would feel more comfortable with Chat GPT in this scenario because it deals with objective data.n this situation because

Thus, the responses can be more accurate"
"Not really, I think it might be an okayish starting point to find info related to your symptoms and then properly discuss them with a professional, rather than exclusively relying on information on a website","It can be faster compared to reading the diverse resources provided by Google, but the risk of the AI hallucinating makes it often unreliable. After asking a question and getting result, it would be necessary to double/triple check the info (even correcting the AI doesn't help with generating non-misleading results in my experience). ","Google search provides reliable information coming from different renowed sources (e.g. Lonely Planet, National Geographi, Maps, etc...)","In my experience, ChatGPT is unreliable and hallucinates pretty often, which makes you waste an incredible amount of time you could use for checking the info on Google yourself tbh"

"Yes, I feel like you can compare all of infomation provided","No, because it might give you wrong advices","Yes, because it has more data and provides more options","Yes, because I like how ChatGPT can gather everything and give you that in a structured way"

Google can misinterpret your symptoms and lead you to thinking your diagnosis is worse than reality.,ChatGPT provides nuance to your diagnosis and may ask further clarifying questions that can narrow your diagnosis.,"Yes, Google provides a variety of websites and sources related to a trip so I feel I have a decision to use my judgement and choose the best option. The variety of sources and autonomy has worked for me when planning trips.","ChatGPT does not offer variety of options to choose from, unless if you specify your preferences in the prompt.

Much more comfortable: Google gives access to medical information. By picking reputable (publicly funded) sources one can get a better understanding of the condition and check it with an expert later.,No comfort. It's unchecked medical advice from a zero-accountability tool that mixes up sources.,"Sure, especially because Google ranks content in a more reliable way (paid first, relevant second) so I can select the sources. It may take longer but it is less likely to mess it all up.","It is low-risk (it's leisure). Still, it is a tool mixing up reputable sources and marketing blurb."

"I google rarely about health topic, and if I do it, I will first check the source and the website, before trusting the information ","Not at all, I don´t see the purpose of asking it about my health ",Because you can check the source and choose between differents informatio s sources ,"No, because I don´t really trust de search function "
"When I do my search I can select and decide which website to trust more, feeling more confortable in reading the answers","Not really.

"Searching for medical information on Google can not only lead to confusion but also to unnecessary anxiety, as we tend to be overly influenced by what we read. Although I occasionally turn to Google for medical opinions, I am aware that there are too many variables to consider. Therefore, whenever I have any doubts about my health, I firmly believe it is best to consult a doctor directly for an accurate and reliable assessment.","Regarding medical matters, I’ve occasionally turned to ChatGPT for insights and information. However, I recognize that I cannot rely solely on this tool for such sensitive topics, as it can sometimes provide inaccurate or not entirely reliable guidance. I firmly believe it’s essential to cross-reference the information with official medical sources and seek the advice of qualified professionals, especially when making decisions that directly impact one’s health.","Using Google, I have the opportunity to explore and compare a wide range of websites, which allows me to identify the best options for planning my trip. This tool enables me to thoroughly evaluate the most interesting activities by analyzing reviews, prices, and suggestions from various sources.
